# Inverted index

This is my training project I've done to learn C memory management.

Basically, this is a simple inverted index where you can index ASCII text files and then search inside of them.

## Usage
To index the file (several files can be indexed):
```
index: *full path to text file*
```

To search within the index (case sensitive):
```
search: *term*
```

# Disclamer

This is a part of Computer Science educational program I'm taking by myself. Everyone can join and
learn computer science with [OSS University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science "OSS University")!
